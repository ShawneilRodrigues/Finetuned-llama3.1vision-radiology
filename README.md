## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. Ensure you have `pip` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShawneilRodrigues/Finetuned-llama3.1vision-radiology.git
cd Finetuned-llama3.1vision-radiology
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the model for radiology image analysis, follow these steps:

1. Load the model:
    ```python
    from model import FinetunedLlamaVision
    model = FinetunedLlamaVision.load_pretrained('path_to_model')
    ```

2. Run inference on an image:
    ```python
    image_path = 'path_to_image'
    result = model.predict(image_path)
    print(result)
    ```

## Model Details
The Llama 3.1 Vision model has been finetuned on a radiology-specific dataset to enhance its performance in interpreting medical images. The model architecture and training techniques ensure high accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset
The dataset used for finetuning consists of various radiological images, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRI images. The images are annotated by medical professionals to provide accurate ground truth for training.

## Training
The training process involves several steps:
1. Preprocessing the images and annotations.
2. Fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 Vision model on the prepared dataset.
3. Evaluating the model's performance on a validation set to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and precision.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using standard metrics for computer vision tasks such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the `evaluation` folder.
